# DLME ?

The Digital Library of The Middle East is an online platform created to provide free access to various cultural heritage materials related to the MENA region. It was launched in 2018 by a collaboration between various organizations and institutions. The platform was designed to help people find and access these materials.
The Digital Library of Middle East and North Africa (DLME) aims to provide a wide range of digital resources to help promote the study and preservation of the region's cultural heritage. It features a variety of materials such as maps, manuscripts, audio and video recordings, and historical artifacts.
The DLME platform provides tools that allow users to search and discover various materials. It also supports digital preservation and metadata management.

# What is discoverability ?

The concept of discoverability is a vital part of information and digital archiving. It refers to the degree to which a piece of information or content can be found in a search engine or in a database. This is an issue in marketing and digital libraries, as information and archives that are not easily accessible to the general public can be considered useless. Through this assignment, I aim to investigate how “discoverable” are two archives from the Digital Library of The Middle East.

# Analysis

To do this, I conducted research on the Digital Library of the Middle East , and ended up choosing two paintings from the “Turkish Collection: Ottoman Reformation to the Republic”. The two paintings are entitled “Eski Sokak” and “Eski bir sokak görünümü” on DLME. 
My research started with finding the first painting “Eski Sokak” (translated to an old street. in Turkish) in the Turkish Collection. According to the metadata provided by DLME, the painting is originally named “Defterdar Yolu” (“Defterdar street”, from Turkish), painted by the Turkish painter Hasan Hayrettin Çizel 1891-1950 (known as Hayri Çizel). His main art themes are landscapes and outdoor views. “Defterdar Yolu”, which according to DLME is undated, stares a beautiful burnt-orange palette landscape, showing a woman in her jilbab walking on a route near a mosque. Since the painting is called Defterdar Yolu, it’s probably an image from Hayri’s eyes of the road leading to Defterdar Camii in Istanbul, Türkiye. It’s a watercolor painting on a 26 x 19 cm canva. Currently, it’s under the protection of Sakip Sabanci Museum in Istanbul, belonging to Sabanci University.
As for the second painting, I found it by typing the title of the first painting “Eski Sokak” in the database’s search bar. I honestly was envisioning either finding a painting with a similar style or not finding anything. The second painting, which was given the name “Eski Bir Sokak Görünümü” (An Old View of a Street, from Turkish) popped up on my screen. Before checking its metadata, the first thing I observed is the similarity in style. Both paintings are landscapes, of Turkish origin, with quite similar color palettes. As soon as I checked the metadata, I understood why these two paintings were cataloged together, using similar titles. 
“Eski Bir Sokak Görünümü” is actually entitled “İstanbul'Da Bir Sokak” (A street in Istanbul), another painting belonging to the painter Hayri Cizel, which explains the similarity in style. The second painting features women wearing their jilbabs and walking in a street again, near mosques. It’s a watercolor painting on a canva measuring 14 x 20 cm. The second piece is also sitting currently in Sabanci Museum, Istanbul. Even though DLME states that the paintings are undated (tarihsiz), both of them definitely come from the same time period (probably early 19s), during the life of Hayri Cizel, 1891-1950.

# Complete or Incomplete metadata ?

The metadata shown above is complete enough, as it includes various details such as the title, type, provenance, painter, and holder of the paintings.
The two paintings from this collection are currently resting in Sabanci Museum. Both have been found, archived and are now under the management of the museum, situated in Sabanci University in Istanbul, Türkiye.
Since both paintings come from the same museum, their metadata has a similar standardized format, which can help people discover them easily in the database. 
However, it’s sure that the metadata would differ if the pieces were scattered apart in different institutions.

# How to make the paintings more discoverable ?

I found the two paintings to be pretty much easy to discover on the database, since they have similar titles. Accessing both of them is also available if the searcher knows the name of the painter. Hence, they are easily found after typing “Hayri Cizel” in the search bar as well.
Currently, the “description” parts of the paintings are empty. So, adding a brief context of the two paintings could help in making them more discoverable, since they have very similar artistic parameters. I finally think that adding a “keywords” category can also contribute to their discoverability. Both of them include “mosques”, “Turkish women wearing jilbabs” and “Istanbul streets”.
